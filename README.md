# YouChat

This project is a simple chat server application implemented in Java. It allows multiple clients to connect to the server, send messages to each other, and retrieve conversation history. The server manages client connections, message broadcasting, and maintains a message history for each user. Clients can send private messages to specific users and request their conversation history with other users.
